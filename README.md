## by Crystina Dang using Google Colaboratory, Jupyter Notebook using mlenv Python environment


## Overview of the analysis:


## Results: 
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- The target is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- The features are 
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
- Removed variables are the 

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- 
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- No
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
- Removing additional unnecessary data
- Adjusting the activation

### Summary: 
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
